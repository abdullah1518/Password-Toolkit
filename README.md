# Password Toolkit

A command-line utility for various password-related security tasks, including strength checking, secure storage, and file encryption.

## Features

*   **Password Meter**: Evaluates the strength of a password based on its entropy and checks for common weaknesses like repeated characters, sequences, and common substrings.
*   **Secure Password Storage**: Creates new user credentials by hashing passwords with a unique salt using the **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256** algorithm.
*   **Bloom Filter Blacklist Check**: Builds and uses a Bloom filter to efficiently check if a password exists in a large blacklist of known compromised passwords.
*   **Simple Cracker Simulator**: Demonstrates the vulnerability of weak passwords by attempting to crack stored user credentials using a dictionary attack.
*   **Authenticated File Encryption**: Encrypts and decrypts files using **AES-GCM**. It uses the username as **Associated Authenticated Data (AAD)** to ensure that the file can only be decrypted by the intended user.

## Requirements

*   Python 3.x
*   `pycryptodome`
*   `rbloom`

You can install the required library using pip:
```bash
pip install pycryptodome
```
```bash
pip install rbloom
```
